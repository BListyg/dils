He graduated from China Pharmacy University. From the 1980s to the 1990s, Li carried out systematic research on non-traditional receptive fields of the retina, external knee bodies and visual cortex nerve cells. Through experimentation, he determined that outside of the traditional receptive fields of retinas and external knee body nerve cells, there exists a "disinhibition zone" several times the area of receptive field. Li proved that the activity of the zone plays a decisive role on regional brightness and brightness grads of transfer graphics. Also he determined that around the receptive field of primary visual cortex nerve cell, there exists a large area that can modulate the response of receptive field, named "conformable field". Based on careful study on the time-space structure and tune characteristics of "conformable field," Li put forward a new theoretical model of receptive fields with "triplicate structure" to explain multiple functions of receptive fields. He won a second-class award for natural science from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a national second-class award for natural science and the He Liang-He Li Science and Progress Award.	http://www.chinavitae.com//biography/Li_Chaoyi/full	-0.992701771250641	0	1.08161961721482e-05

In the 1980s, Chen studied system identification, adaptation control and random approaches. He came up with the convergence velocity of common identification algorithms and estimated the parameters of closed loop control system. Chen used a disturbance method to make estimated parameters come close to their real value, and at the same time, made performance indices close to their optimization. With regard to stochastic approximation, Chen put forward boundary variation truncation algorithms and introduced definite direct analytical methods. He removed the restrictive conditions to regression functions and lowered the noise requirements to the minimum, making the application scope of stochastic approximation greatly expanded. Chen also successfully applied these innovations to such fields as random adaptation ballast control, wide range of optimization and dynamic system of discrete events. Chen is an expert on automatic control theory.	http://www.chinavitae.com//biography/Chen_Hanfu/full	-0.992701771249718	1189	1.08161961721482e-05

Yu revealed the electrochemical nature of changeable charge soil, enriched and modified some soil chemical theories originated from constant charge soil and contributed to the establishment of a soil chemical system combined with characters of these two soils. He establish a soil chemical system centered on the relationship of electrified particles (colloid charge, ion, proton and electrons) and their chemical performances through 3 monographs which had character and was correlated, enabling this system to become an independent branch.

He graduated from the Shanghai Medical Institute. Han is a professor at the Medical Department of Beijing University, and he serves as director of the Nerve Science Institute. Han has had a distinguished career in the study of acupuncture and its effects on the body and mind. He has devoted himself to the study of the acupuncture analgesia mechanism since 1965. He was the first to describe the time-space distribution pattern of analgesia due to an acupunctured acupoint on the human body. Han also proved that the secretion of abirritate chemicals by the nervous system, including hydroxyl tryptamine and endorphin, is stimulated by acupuncture. He found that specific NPY may be released in the human brain by stimulating acupoints with electricity, when the frequency is carefully adjusted. However, he also found that if the stimulation lasts for more than 2 hours, anti-analgesia chemicals, such as CCK, would be secreted in the brain. He proposed that the effect of acupuncture relies on the amounts of analgesia and anti-analgesia chemicals in addition to the relative balance between both kinds of chemicals. A nerve stimulator developed based on the principle delivers the effect of analgesia and anti-spasm, and may be used to cure the diacetylmorphine habituation. Han Jisheng was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1993.	http://www.chinavitae.com//biography/Han_Jisheng/full	-0.968010319899106	3	1.08286765011102e-05

He graduated from Kunming Southwest United University and received his doctorate from California Polytechnic Institute. Early in his career, Shen engaged in research on antibiotics and microorganism biochemistry. He discovered that when aureomycin is decomposing hexose, the movement of the pentose cycle is related to the synthesis of anreomycin, thus the output of aureomycin is increased. In studying the biological synthetic process of streptomycin, he proved the role of the ornithine cycle and that arginine is the source of guanidyl in molecular chain carbamidine parts of streptomycin. Shen also found that the transamidine reaction between such arginine and chain carbamidine is controlled by tension. In studying sugar metabolism, he also found methylglyoxal synthetic enzyme in colibacillus. He pointed out that hexose can be metabolized by the branch of lactose produced by 3	http://www.chinavitae.com//biography/Shen_Shanjion/full	-0.992701771249752	0	1.08161961721482e-05

He graduated from Huaxi University in 1951. Zhao Ermi has described and named 38 new series (or sub-series) of amphibians and reptiles and two new genera of amphibians. "China Amphibious Reptile Zoology," written with American scholar Kraig Adler, was the first monograph to comprehensively describe 661 series of amphibians and reptiles in China. Zhao was one of the first amphibian and reptile scholars to enter Tibet for investigation purposes. He added 8 new series for Tibet and 10 newly recorded series in China or Tibet and was the first to report that cobras appeared in Motuoxirang and he moved its distribution scope northwards 4 degrees in latitude. This was considered to be evidence that sub-tropic animals diffused northward along vapor passages of the Brahmaputra Great Valley. Zhao was also the first to propose adding a new "sub-area of the south slope of the Himalayas" to the southwest area in animal geographic divisions mainly according to the distribution of reptiles. He was the first to introduce his idea concerning the district system formation of amphibians and reptiles on the West Pacific Island chains and distribution pattern of amphibians and reptiles in temperate zones of East Asia.

He discovered that aberrance of species in configuration due to high altitude was aberrance within species. He also illustrated that wings of locusts degenerated since strong wind on the Plateau were not suitable to allow locusts to fly and the degeneration of wings caused degeneration of pronounced organs. The degeneration of pronounced organs caused degeneration and disappearance of the hearing organ. Series that lived on the Plateau without wings, with pronounced organs, and a hearing organ were the most evolved series, and also a special series on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Yin proposed the viewpoint of adaptability of the Plateau no-wing type on the Plateau and established a new classification system of the general family of the Chinese Locust and suggested the viewpoint that Tanaoceridae in North America was the middle type of grasshopper to evolve to locusts.

Pei graduated from Shenyang Pharmaceutical University in 1982 and received a master's degree from the institution 2 years later. Pei mainly dealt with research on cell signal transducing and its regulating mechanism. He made use of G albumen coupling receptor variances and verified the hypothesis of receptor excitation balancing states. He found that the C end of the baica receptor (G albumen coupling) generates phosphorylation under the action of agonist and results in antianaphylaxis of the baica receptor. He revealed the important role of the baica receptor signal antianaphylaxis and negative feedback regulation in the formation of the baica habituation. He also proved that there exists crosstalk between excited amino acid receptors and the baica receptors. He found that oxidated low-density lipoprotein can activate the p38MAPK through G albumen channels and restrains the growth of smooth muscle cells. Pei found that the TCM effective ingredient trichosanthis albumen can combine with HIV common receptors (chemotaxis factor receptor), strengthen the excitation of the receptors and thus bring anti-HIV into play. He also revealed that the chemotaxis factor receptor of the fifth span-membrane has the function of normal seventh span-membrane G albumen coupling receptor.	http://www.chinavitae.com//biography/Pei_Gang/full	-1.1048962031608	82.5	1.08227646030661e-05

Zhao made significant achievements in fields such as hadron physics of particle physics and quantum chromody namics. He started with the basic relations of the QCD axis vector flow abnormality and was the first to research phenomenology. Along with his graduate students, Zhao also researched NRQCD and heavy quark couple physics and was the first to discover the contribution of color octet states in strong disintegration to QCD radiation modification. He proved the balance out effect of infrared radiation and width of P wave couple strong disintegration in accord with laboratory tests. He determined that the color octet state could improve the generation rate of D wave couples by more than two OMs. Zhao also predicted that the section that appears on J/Y after the clash of positive electron and negative electron is mainly generated by a color octet state; this prediction had been proved by laboratory testing of two B baryton factories in the USA and Japan. Together with his research partners, Zhao created a baryon chart with strangeness numbers equal to -2, -3, and this prediction has also been validated by the finding of baryons such as W*(2250). Zhao is a professor at Beijing University.	http://www.chinavitae.com//biography/Zhao_Guangda/full	-0.944646786864912	0	1.08187250493154e-05

Along with Professor Ding Qinsheng, Lei proposed the transmission theory of the equilibrium equation, which, after years of development, became a method for the transmission research of the semi-conductor's hot-carrier, and which is known internationally as the Lei-Ding Theory. During the early 1990s Lei also developed the transmission model of the super crystal lattice strip. He set up the hot-carrier transmission equation for any energy spectrum materials in the electrical or magnetic field. Lei recently proposed a new method for the research of the semi-conductor's transmission and optical property under the strong far-infrared radiation.

He graduated from Zhejiang University in 1952. Jin studied the pharmacological roles of the TCM corydalis tuber and proved l-THP is the main effective ingredient and retarder of the dopamine(DA) receptor. He also proved that l-THP has abirritation and also stabilization properties. Based on the stabilization of l-THP, Jin inaugurated the research field of THPB's effect on dopamine receptors. He discovered the dual roles of l-SPD, D1 excitation and D2 retardance. This new pharmacological role, coincident with current new argumentation about the pathogeny of schizophrenia (i.e., poor function of pallium prefrontal lobe D1 receptor, while there is hyperfunction of the cortex lower structure's D2 receptor and the first dual-functional stabilizer), led to a new direction for the development of anti-chlorpromazine medicine research. With respect to molecular pharmacological research, Jin proposed a topological diagram that showed that l-SPD and D1 receptors interact. He also proved that dual hydroxide group-THPBs is a type matter with dual-role characteristics. A national invention patent was granted to one of the new compounds.	http://www.chinavitae.com//biography/Jin_Guozhang/full	-0.992701771249912	0	1.08161961721482e-05

Concerning the least-square self tuning regulator, Guo solved its stability and astringency, a problem that had puzzled the international control community for a long time. By introducing new ideas and methods, Guo established the estimation theory of a common nonequilibrium time-varying parameter system. He laid the stringent theoretical foundation of three types of track algorithms commonly used, including LMS, RLS and KF. With regard to "Feedback", the most basic concept in control theory, Guo put forward the theoretical framework of the basic problem, qualitatively studying "Maximum Capacity and Limit of Feedback Mechanism". As to several types of typical nonlinear uncertain dynamic systems, Guo achieved the critical value of feedback mechanisms coping with a maximum capacity of uncertainty.

According to nanism genetic mode and allelic relations, Lu divided the current main indicia rice nanism resources of our country into two categories and four groups. He conducted genetic analysis of the nucleoplasmic interaction of male sterility paddies and found that the fertility restoration genes are the same, Rf1 and Rf2. Since the hybrid sterility and affinity of cultivated paddies are controlled by the pollen sterile gene of at least six loca, Lu put forward the new concept of the "pathoklisis gene". For the first time, he established that the pachytene core type of three wild paddy types originated in China.	http://www.chinavitae.com//biography/Lu_Yonggen/full	-0.944646786864899	43	1.08187250493154e-05

He has many years of experience in star physics research, and he has made considerable contributions concerning non-conservatory binary-star evolution, stellar wind shock wave theory, and the material damage caused by stellar wind. Huang found that material damage existing in binary stars and various complex factors occurred during loss of angular momentum and established a strict mathematical base for non-conservatory binary-star evolution. This discovery resulted in the first proposal in joint efforts with Weigert concerning stellar wind shock wave theory, and has been widely recognized internationally. In joint efforts with Weigert, Huang found an important effect imposed by overshot convection on the evaluation of stars and proposed a method to judge the area of the overshooting zone by using the evolution process of the Cepheid variable. This study has enabled the determination of overshot convection with astronomical observation.

Moreover, the professor has invented a multi-channel filter, which is functioning as a pivotal part of a solar multi-channel telescope, said to be the most advanced observation instrument on earth. At present, Ai's project of a two-dimensional real-time spectrograph is well under way. He aims to be able to see directly through the fluctuations of the magnetic and velocity fields of the solar chromosphere and photosphere. His solar magnetic field telescope has not only been awarded a state prize for scientific and technological development, but is also used in several other countries. As an international academic authority on solar physics, Ai has proposed several theories on the precursor of the red shift of solar flares, features of the magnetic field of the penumbra, magnetic reversal on the chromosphere, and the compressional force-free field mode of the flare.	http://www.chinavitae.com//biography/Ai_Guoxiang/full	-0.316740923803716	0	1.08260257659413e-05

He set forth that direct anterior substances synthesized by arabidopsis botanical auxin (heteroauxing, IAA) mainly come from the intermediate products of the tryptophan synthetic channel indole-3-phosphoglycerol (IGP). He systematically appraised and studied the answering gene of rapeseed element lactone and discovered that the rapeseed element lactone can promote cell division through inducing the expression of cell cycle protein genes, which can substitute for cytokinin in the culture of rapeseed cell. Li advanced a presumption that there may exist a new rapeseed element lactone signal transducing channel in botanical cells. He developed a botanical expression library inversion method that contributes to systemically appraise botanical function cells. He also divided a batch of rapeseed mutants in which growth properties, such as plant type and fertility, incur alternation, and cloned related genes.

Nucleus Theoretical Physicist	NA	NA	female	NA	In the 1960s Zhang Zongye discovered, together with her research partners, the atomic nucleus coherent structure and coherent structure fluctuate model theory and thus successfully explained the main characteristics of low excitation state of atomic nucleus near 16O. In 1976, she theoretically predicted that the super symmetry state exists in super nucleus and thisprediction was later proved by laboratory tests carried out by foreign scientists in 1980. Since the 1980s, Zhang has systematically researched the Quark Model Theory of nuclear force and educed transferring force that generate positive/negative quark pair via a single gluon exchange, and thus obtained a reasonable nucleon-baryton apex angle function, which paved the way for the research of baryton exchange mechanism of nuclear force from the point of view of quarks. She proposed the theory of error function-type quark confinement forces which includes the shield-effect of quark sea thereby resolving the problem of an unreasonable long tail of Sefanvaers Force. Zhang Zongye was named an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1999.	http://www.chinavitae.com//biography/Zhang_Zongye/full	-0.894270514812486	457.5	1.08170151648543e-05

He graduated from Nanjing University. Li Jijun was professor of the Geography Department of Lanzhou University. He has studied glaciology, physiognomy and quaternary. Li is well known for studying the bulging of Qing-Tibet Highland and its influence on the environment. As a result, he hypothesized that the Highland was leveled twice and rose thrice during the late Cenozoic era, with the latest intense rising commencing 3.6m years ago, preceding through the Qing-Tibet Movement (3.6m - 1.7m years), the Kunhuang Movement (1.2m - 0.6m years) and the Republic Movement (0.15m years) until it reached its present height, accumulating 3,500 - 4,000m. He has also pointed out that multiple-level terracing in the upstream of the Yellow River has been the reflection of rising stages of the highland, formed 1.7m, 1.5m, 1.2m, 0.6m, 0.15m years ago, respectively. He also carried out detailed probing into Tibet and the modern glaciers crossing its mountain ranges. He was the first to point out that there is a great deal of wet and hot relief relics, and certain cold and mud flow relief systems in Lushan Mountain, replacing the older interpretations of the formation of glaciers. He studied the environmental changes of loess and ancient soils near Lanzhou, reconstructing the environmental flux in comparison with the ice core of the South Pole over the last 150,000 years. Li Jijun was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1991.	http://www.chinavitae.com//biography/Li_Jijun/full	-0.923232073612037	1007	1.0832260638634e-05

A plant physiologist, Shen carried out experiments on the transition of carbohydrate with plans and proved that amylase could influence the ability of phosphorlyase to synthesize starch by resolving quickly the added starch. In doing so, he negated ideas that amylase had a direct prohibitive function. In the 1960s, he started research on the mechanism of photosynthesis. This led him to discover the existence of an intermediate state of high energy during the process of photophosphorylation and advanced the notion that an intermediate state could exist in many forms. Shen also posited that the allosteric difference of coupling factors could affect the scattering and disappearing of the intermediate state of high energy and the efficiency of coupling. His research eventually led him to analyze the relation between the transitive function of energy and membrane structure.

Academician, Professor	NA	NA	female	E28D2241-C9B2-4782-8456-2C6165225F9A	Zhao Yufen, female, Han nationality, obtained a doctorate degree from New York State University in the USA. Her primary research fields include life organophosphorus chemistry, biological organic chemistry, organic synthesis chemistry and life origin. Zhao invented the production method of the new anti-cancer medicine cephalotaxine parent nucleus and developed a series of new non-toxic anti-schistosome compounds. She discovered that the saturated solution of the phosphoramidic acid may incise RNA and DNA. The principle of the incision is similar to that of the hydrolyzing of the phosphodiesterase in biochemistry. Zhao is conducting the research of the nucleic acid fixed-point incising agent by cooperating with Ohio University in the USA. Zhao also discovered that N - Phosphoramidic acid itself may be developed into polypeptide and turn nucleoside phosphinylidyne into ribotide. Therefore, N - Phosphoramidic acid may simultaneously generate the titanium pool, the nucleic acid pool, and the compound titanium - nucleic acid pool during the same reaction process. In terms of life origin, Zhao discovered that phosphoramidic acid can generate nucleic acid, albumen as well as LB-film and liposome, which is therefore the smallest system of life evolution. Zhao has taken charge of and completed many major projects of the State Natural Science Fund and science projects of the Outstanding Youth Fund and the Excellent Talents Fund of the State Education Commission, which have won second and third class Science and Technology Advancement Awards of the Chinese Academy of Science, the first China Youth Scientist Award and 2 second class Science and Technology Advancement Awards of the State Education Commission.

Guo is known as one of the initiators of slab structure and terrain structure research. He has long been devoted to the tectonic structure research of the south and southeast regions of China and he has achieved considerable results. Guo was the first to discover that the Jiangnan Proterozoic trench-arc basin system formed due to the plate movement and subduction existing in South China, which dispelled the concept that the slab structure was limited to the late phanerozoic time. Guo established the evolutionary pattern of the South China structure, and proved the overall NW-SE transition trend of the subduction slab boundary. He found the distribution pattern of ore belt and oil/gas resources in South China, identified eight indicators of continental margin, and unveiled the formation mechanism of Type A down-going inland slab and foreland basins in China. He based these findings on the pattern of ophiolitic melange, origin and time/space distribution of granite, evolution of the tectonic stress field, features of the deep-seated structure, and terrain makeup and dispersing. In recent years, Professor Guo has been studying the coupling mechanism between the mainland dynamics and mountain basins.

He graduated from Shanghai Medical College in 1952. Since the early 1970s Zeng Yi has researched the relationship of the EB virus and nasopharynx cancer, established a series of serum diagnosis methods for nasopharynx cancer, and , increased the diagnosis rate of nasopharynx cancer at the early stage from 20-30% to 80-90%. His serum index could predict the occurrence possibility of nasopharynx cancer 5 to 10 years in advance. Yi was also the first to establish the cell plant for nasopharynx cancer from high differentiation and low differentiation because all of these cell plants had DNV and albumen of EB virus. He discovered Chinese herbal medicines, carcinogens in plants and foods in areas with a high incidence of nasopharynx cancer. He also discovered that certain oxygen bacillus on human nasopharynx parts could produce butyric acid. Yi discovered genes chained with HLA that tended to be infected by nasopharynx cancer and was the first in the world to prove under cooperative function of carcinogen TPA and butyric acid that the human fetus mucous membrane in parts infected by EB virus could induced human nasopharynx cancer in rats. This was direct evidence that the EB virus could induce nasopharynx cancer and at the same time provided models for multiple factors of nasopharynx cancer pathogens and functional mechanism. Since 1984 Yi has conducted research on HIV and AIDS and proved the introduction of HIV into China. He separated the first Chinese HIV-1 noxious plant in 1987 and established the rap diagnosis method for HIV. Yi also discovered that some Chinese herbal medicines had a relatively high probability of prohibiting copies of HIV.	http://www.chinavitae.com//biography/Zeng_Yi/full	-0.992701771249918	0	1.08161961721482e-05

In the early 1980s, he took the lead in finding GnRH had a direct effect towards matrixes. In recent years, he advanced the view that fibre lyase proto-activation factor (tPA) produced from grain cell (GC) and inhibiting factor (PAI-1) expressed by thin coating cell (TC) plays an important role in regulating outbursts of egg follicles. He also discovered that, GC and TC, stimulated by relevant hormones, coordinate with tPA and PAI-1 gene expressions and induce ovulation. At the same time, he took the lead finding that the progesterone synthesized from GC could be utilized by TC to produce androgens and that the interaction of GC and TC is the premise of ovary synthesizing estrogen. Making use of this system, Liu further studied the roles of physiological process, such as semen generation, luteal atrophy and delivery, obtaining important results. He published more than 150 theses, including more than 60 scientific theses, which were frequently cited by relevant literatures both home and abroad. Collaborating with others, he recognized Hardy's socket at the head of the amphioxus (i.e., anlage of pituitary).

He graduated from Harbin Industrial University. Liu has taught as a professor at Shanghai University Mechanics Research Institute. He has long been engaged in the research of pneumatic theory of turbomachine and hydromechanics. Based on Wu Zhonghua's 3D fluid theory of turbomachine, he established a new theory system with the variation theory as a foundation. Liu introduced a systematic channel of the establishment and transformation of the hydromechanical variation principle. He was the first scientist to set up variation principle and broad-sense variation principle families of positive proposition, reverse proposition and cross proposition of turbomachine's 3D flow. Liu discovered optimized design theory about the 3D cascade and runner, combined with optimized cybernetics. He developed a field change and variation theory and a finite element method in which various unknown interfaces can be automatically captured. He also put forward a series of new general functions for hydromechanics, and explored general theory and solution about mapping space of 3D flow reverse - cross proposition. In the last few decades, Liu has emphasized new directions, such as reverse proposition of nonsteady pneumatic mechanics, reverse proposition of multi-working condition points hydromechanics and pneumatic - thermal - elastic coupling theory. Liu Gaolian won the second award of national natural science in 1987, and was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1999.	http://www.chinavitae.com//biography/Liu_Gaolian/full	-0.94464678686493	20	1.08187250493154e-05

He is presently a professor and the director of the Institute of Geology and Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He also serves as vice-chairman of the Chinese Quaternary Science Committee. He became vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2008. Ding Zhongli has been researching paleoclimatology and the Chinese loess deposits for over twenty years. He and his co-authors systematically investigated the loess stratigraphy of the Loess Plateau, demonstrated the continuity of the loess-soil sequence by correlating the loess sections of the Plateau, and subdivided the loess deposits into 37 pedostratigraphical units in the past 2.6 Ma. He established an orbitally-tuned time scale for the loess sequence on the basis of the Baoji grain-size record, and detected the major Milankovitch climate periodicities from it and identified three climatic shift events that happened at about 2.6, 1.6 and 0.8 Ma BR. By correlating the climate records of the loess with those of the deep-sea sediments, he showed that changes in global ice volume may have been a major factor in driving glacia-interglacial variations of the Asian monsoon system over the past 0.8 Ma. In recent years, he studied the magnetostratigraphy, sedimentology and geochemistry of the red clay deposits underlying the quaternary loess in the Loess Plateau, and provided more evidence for the wind-blown origin of the red clay. He extended the eolian record in the Plateau to about 8 Ma. Ding Zhongli has published about 150 papers to date, with 65 of them in the academy's journals. His results have been cited 998 times, ranking him as one of the top 1% of citation authors in the global earth science community in the past decade.	http://www.chinavitae.com//biography/Ding_Zhongli/full	-0.709444863444481	1249.5	1.08220423358296e-05

He is a physicist who graduated from the Technical Physics Department of Peking University in 1956. Wang has focused his academic career on studying nuclear physics and conducting laser plasma physical experiments. He has served as a researcher of the Shanghai Plasma Research Institute and the director of the Shanghai High Power Laser Physics National Lab. In the 1960s, he researched neutron flash detectors in liquid contained cadmium at the United Nucleus Research Institute in the former Soviet Union and discovered relatively high precision measurements of resonate neutron fission parameters. The same decade, he adopted optimal designed gas detectors in nuclear testing and determined the thermal nuclear reaction time. His laser experiments led to the creation of more than ten types of diagnosis instruments as well as to the development of X-ray laser research. By the end of the 1980s, he was recognized as a leader in this field. Wang later obtained the approximate wavelength X-ray lasers on middle and small laser drives. He then went to Japan with a team and applied even ray focus and double-target connection technology to discover high plus saturation, eke-nickel and silver lasers, and other laser related research. In 1999, Wang was elected as an academician to the Chinese Academy of Sciences.	http://www.chinavitae.com//biography/Wang_Shiji/full	-0.965394068531033	96	1.08274844866208e-05

Professor Liu has focused his studies on quantum chemistry, and especially the nature of hydrogen bonds and ligand field theoretical methods. After 1980, he was focused on the theoretical research in chemistry reaction, proposing a new theory towards the substitute radicals that would change the reactors while affecting reaction mechanisms. Liu predicted the existence of certain unstable alien bodies towards alienated reaction and this theory was confirmed by experiments later. He exposed the root of the production of negative activation energy in free radical reactions. Using the orbitron coupling effect, he introduced the origin of spin inhibition reaction, which certified that under specific conditions, vibrating excitation of non-breaking bonds can also promote reaction. Currently, Professor Liu focuses on the theoretical research of excitation state reaction potential interfaces and related optical chemical reaction and weak interaction among big molecules.

He graduated from the Peking College of Geoscience in 1955. Ma engaged in the study of geologic structure, earthquake prediction, geodynamics for most of his career. In 1964, he completed a minor structural study of joint qualitative support in stages, which widely was adopted in the teaching of structural geology in China. He also advanced the idea of long, middle and short asymptotic accumulation modes of earthquake, which became the main principle and working procedure for forecasting strong earthquakes in China. Among his other accomplishments, he founded modern geodynamics, established three global modern geologic structure systems and discussed the rhythm of earth motion and asymmetry. As a result of his studies, he advanced an earth rotation theory based on the layered angular adjusting movement of earth crust, mantle, and earth core and dynamic mode theory. This, combined with thermodynamics, barodynamics and fluid mechanics, resulted in new analysis and integration for the global structural dynamic modes and provided the support for studying disasters and minerals.

As a researcher at the China Research Institute of Space Technology, Hu was engaged in the research of elastic mechanics, including equilibrium, stability and vibration. He was also involved in the research of plastic mechanics and hydrodynamics. In 1956, Hu was responsible for establishing the generalized variation principle of three classes of variables in elastic mechanics and plastic mechanics for the first time. He took a lead in directing his colleagues and students to apply such principles to seek approximate solutions. Kutsu Kuichiro, a Japanese scientist, reestablished the above principle a year later. Owing to its important application in finite element method and other approximation solutions, the principle was widely introduced and cited in the academic literature, special works and textbooks of the USA, Japan, the U.K., the Soviet Union, Germany and France, and was named the "Kutsu Kuichiro Principle". Hu Haichang was elected to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1980.	http://www.chinavitae.com//biography/Hu_Haichang/full	-0.992701771249928	0	1.08161961721482e-05

This was one of the mechanisms concerning chromosome meiosis appearing within body cells in the world. Zheng has researched cytomixis and was the first to confirm that the piercing wall movement of chromatin between pollen master cells was a spontaneous normal physiological phenomenon. He also discovered a close relationship between the movement of karyolymph and the piercing wall movement of contract albumen and chromatin. Zheng recently published a thesis entitled "Cell Chemical Positioning of Fiber Enzyme Activeness at Very Early Stage I of Lily Pollen Master Cell Meiosis and its Relationship with Silks Among Hypo-Generated Cells," which resulted in answering the question it posed. Zheng had several achievements in embryogenesis of body cells, protoplast cultivation, cultivation of anther and germen without pollination, and filtering of a crop variety that could resist salt and hereditary transformation.

He also showed that electrolytes could transfer in the bioplasm of tissues. He also proved that plasmodesma can change into open channel in proper conditions, allowing large grain such as bioplasm and viruses to pass through. With respect to research concerning the overall reaction in plants adapting to environment variation, Lou found that the transfer of electrochemical waves (action, variance, continual concussion) in the body is not limited to several sensitive plants, but will appear in common plants in proper conditions. When plants in their local parts (such as their root systems) are excited or damaged, or are intimidated by adversity, they will emit electrochemical wave or hormone, which, through vascular bundle, quickly transfer to corona, and produce a reaction on laminae (e.g., pore is closed). He also applied "botanic growth regulator" to regulating crop bearing to get rid of field weeds and thus developed a trash coverage farming reduction operation that maintains water and soil in farmland and saves manpower. Finally, Lou initiated research about agricultural modernization in drought area and breeding transplantation.	http://www.chinavitae.com//biography/Lou_Chenghou/full	-0.992701771249922	0	1.08161961721482e-05

He was born in 1955, graduated from the chemistry department of the Wuzhou Branch School of Jiangxi Normal College, and obtained a doctorate from the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Science. He is a research professor. Professor Shi has pursued long term studies of the growth of synthetic crystals and related theories. He participated in the development and industrialization of synthetic colored quartz, conducting systematic research into defects of the crystal and interrelations between its growth conditions and properties. Based on this, he suggested a double-doping strategy and a responsive color-core model. While conducting his postdoctoral research in South Korea, he carried out studies on the synthesis of perovskite thin films by the hydrothermal method. He studied the preparation of various crystallites with the hydrothermal method, such as barium titanate, zirconium oxide, aluminum oxide, bismuth germanate, titanium oxide, zinc oxide, spinel and composite mixtures of aluminum oxide and zirconium oxide. In particular, he engaged in research on the interrelationships of hydrothermal conditions with the structure of crystallite, particle size, growth morphology, physical phases and defects. He suggested the concept of aggregation processes in hydrothermal synthesis systems. His recent research is focused on morphological studies of the synthesis of high temperature semi-conductor materials. Starting from a model about crystal growth, he systematically exposes the internal associations of structure and morphology of crystals with physical and chemical conditions set for the synthesis. His work provides theoretical support for the optimization of synthesis conditions and related properties of the crystalline materials and also introduces new possibilities for computational crystallography. Shi served as the secretary-general of the Chinese Academy of Sciences until 2004, and he was promoted as vice-president in that same year.	http://www.chinavitae.com//biography/Shi_Erwei/full	-0.820273570244629	59	1.08199086318827e-05

Specialist in Mechanics, Member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences	1940	NA	male	E28D2241-C9B2-4782-8456-2C6165225F9A	Bai Yilong, male, Han nationality, is a native of Xiangyun, Yunnan Province. His ancestral home is in Tianjin. He was born in 1940, graduated from the Chinese University of Science and Technology in 1963. He is a specialist in mechanics. Instead of usually presuming that the material becomes unstable at a stress maximum, Bai Yilong derived the model equations governing the thermo-plastic shear deformation. Then he obtained the criterion to the shear instability, the evolving law of localization and some new features of the late-stage shear band, which were referred to as the 'Bai Model' and 'Bai Criterion' in some references. According to the analysis on the localization, he applied the concept of instability and shear band to ductile limit and failure, and explained some previously unexplainable observations. By creating the technique of sub-microsecond stress pulse, he founded the experimental and non-equilibrium statistical basis of numerous micro damages occurring in materials subjected to impact loading.	http://www.chinavitae.com//biography/Bai_Yilong/full	-1.20522706682795	503	1.08206371191136e-05
