Data-Informed Link Strength. Combine multiple-relationship networks into a single weighted network.
}
\description{
Combine multiple-relationship networks into a single weighted network.  The approach is similar to factor analysys in the that contribution from each constituent network varies so as to maximize the information gleaned from the multimetwork.  This implementation uses an Item-Response Theory (IRT) model estimated with a custom Gibbs Sampler.
