Description: Combine multiple-relationship networks into a single weighted
    network.  The approach is similar to factor analysys in the that
    contribution from each constituent network varies so as to maximize the
    information gleaned from the multimetwork.  This implementation uses an
    Item-Response Theory (IRT) model estimated with a custom Gibbs Sampler.
